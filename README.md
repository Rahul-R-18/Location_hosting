This code is part of the app my team made for Praxis Engineering to implement efficiencies in scheduling work/meetings 
using the employees' calendars, locations, emails, and other information.

The code in lh.py records the user's location every ten minutes and sends the data to Firebase's Realtime Database 
for cost-effective data storage. The code uses Flutter's Geolocation package.
